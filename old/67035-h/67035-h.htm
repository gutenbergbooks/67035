<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>STOP IN
TIME.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Patty</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I had put things straight
after I got home last night, and could sit down quietly and think
over our strange conversation, my heart sank within me.&nbsp; I
was so hurried for fear of being late for the coach, while we
were talking, and so grieved and surprised by what you told me,
that I could not, there and then, go much beyond the sad news
itself.&nbsp; Dear heart! what sorrow and shame in a decent
family!&nbsp; And so nice a girl too, as your cousin
seemed.&nbsp; Her father will scarce ever lift up his head after
it, to say nothing of a poor child brought into the world with a
stain on its birth, and without a right to a father&rsquo;s care;
both mother and child a reproach to each other.</p>
<p>But after all, it is not so much that, as what you said along
of it that has gone so sorely against my heart.&nbsp; Why, my
dear child, where have you heard such things?&nbsp; Whoever it is
that has put them into your head has some bad design upon you,
you may be quite sure.&nbsp; If it be a man, be he who he will,
he means you harm.&nbsp; Man or woman, they are no decent
body&rsquo;s thoughts, at any rate.&nbsp; Only following nature,
indeed!&nbsp; You did not think that was an excuse when the
servant girl took your ribbon, for all it was nature <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>enough in her
to like a bit of finery.&nbsp; What! and are we to liken
ourselves to the beasts that perish?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether it is most wicked or most foolish to make a pretence that
their ways can ever be a guide to us.&nbsp; It is setting the ass
to drive the man, for sure, if we are to learn from them.&nbsp;
Has not God made man quite different from the brutes?&nbsp; Has
not He made him in His own image, and given him laws to keep, and
reason and conscience to guide him in keeping them?&nbsp; The
commonest things of every day shew us on what a different footing
we reckon ourselves.&nbsp; We do not punish the animal that
breaks through our fence and eats our hay-grass, for it has had
no laws given to it, and has no knowledge of right or wrong; but
we deal very differently with the man who watches his
opportunity, and takes the meal out of our bin.</p>
<p>And as to pretending that there can be no great harm in a sin
because it is common, no honest mind can be deceived by so plain
a falsity.&nbsp; Heaven knows thieving is common enough, cheating
and lying are common enough, drunkenness, swearing and
housebreaking are common enough; but no one goes so far us to
pretend that these are not wrong on that account.&nbsp; Why,
child, there would not need to be all this hiding, and shame, and
even child-murder, if every one did not know quite well in their
own hearts that the thing was a sore evil, sin and
disgrace.&nbsp; Never lend an ear on the devil&rsquo;s side,
above all on this subject.&nbsp; It does not do for any woman to
dally and balance between right and wrong on such slippery
ground.&nbsp; If she does, she is sure to lose her footing.&nbsp;
The only safety is in the straight open road of right.&nbsp; Keep
to it, and never play and trifle with the first leadings to evil
ways.&nbsp; No one can forecast what misery one heedless step in
these slippery bye-paths may bring after it.&nbsp; What do you,
or what does any decent young girl know <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>about the hidden dangers, and
pit-falls, and the vice, and the wretchedness that make old
hearts sorrowful to think of?</p>
<p>The subject is a painful one; but it is much too serious and
weighty to slur over because it is awkward to speak upon
it.&nbsp; Such truths as these should be solemnly laid before the
young, for they need to hear them above others; and since in this
your father cannot so well talk quite plainly to you, it is for
your aunt, who loves you as a mother, to take a mother&rsquo;s
place.&nbsp; Mark what I say&mdash;there is a deal of difference
between man and woman in this matter.&nbsp; Though they sin
together, the woman sinks by far the lowest.&nbsp; How God will
judge hereafter between the two, I am not now going to ask; but
in this world the shame and loss come much heavier upon the
woman.&nbsp; Modesty is, above all else, a woman&rsquo;s virtue,
and the loss of it is a terrible blot, which lays her open to the
contempt of all, even of the very man who robs her of it.&nbsp; I
have heard tell that it was said by a very knowing man, who wrote
a great many wise things long ago, &ldquo;When a woman gives
herself up to a man, and goes the whole length with him, it binds
her closer to him, but it cures the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
said by a French writer more than a hundred years ago, and that
only shows the more plainly that it is a truth of all times, and
all countries.&nbsp; And look if it is not so.&nbsp; Do not we
see in a hundred cases, up and down, that the man leaves the
woman in her disgrace, and cares no more about her?</p>
<p>Patty, my lass, hear a plain word from your old aunt.&nbsp; If
a woman is the first to come forward, or is over ready to follow
on the first beckoning, a man knows pretty well that he need not
put himself out of the way to marry her in order to have her; and
if he is unprincipled or thoughtless, he will take advantage <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of her
weakness, and sin and shame will follow, as sure as night follows
evening.&nbsp; My child, take a good counsel from one that loves
you.&nbsp; If any man, let him be who he will, follows after you,
and you care for him ever so much, aye, and trust him for meaning
to make you his wife ever so surely, keep him in his right place,
and do not let him go one step beyond what is decent.&nbsp; He
will respect you the more, and his love will be the deeper and
the truer in the end.&nbsp; Mind this&mdash;if you show yourself
willing to go half way with him, he will never be the one to stop
you.&nbsp; It rests with you to take care of yourself, and to
help him too, to keep in the right road, so that you may both
stand before God and man on your wedding-day, honest, and free
from blame and shame.</p>
<p>But Patty, my dear, all this has not been much more than
worldly wisdom, but we are bound to look beyond that, and to
consider the solemn command of Almighty God to keep ourselves
modest and pure in His sight as the servants of Christ.&nbsp;
Some would say I had begun at the wrong end in speaking first of
earthly shame and earthly credit; but I think that, may-be, young
folks listen readiest when we do not begin too seriously with
them.&nbsp; But, dear child, I could not with a good conscience
end, without laying before you, with my heart&rsquo;s prayer for
God&rsquo;s help, what His holy Word says about this grave sin of
fornication and uncleanness.</p>
<p>In these days we seem to think we can make it lighter by
giving it an easier name&mdash;speaking of the fornicator as
&ldquo;wild&rdquo; or &ldquo;gay,&rdquo; and miscalling a
woman&rsquo;s shame &ldquo;misfortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; But let us
hear what God&rsquo;s word says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Marriage is
honourable in all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But fornication and all
uncleanness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh
saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What! know ye not that your body is
the temple of the Holy Ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>The
marriage law was given to man in the very beginning by God
himself, who ordained it to be a sacred state, in which two
should be as one flesh.&nbsp; Our blessed Saviour speaks of the
wedded pair as &ldquo;those whom God hath joined
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; What shall we say then of such as despise
God&rsquo;s ordinance, and set at defiance the restraint He has
laid upon them, as though that was not needful which He has
commanded?&nbsp; They who, in despite of His word, are as one
flesh together without the holy bond of marriage, are wilful
sinners against God, insulting His will, and defying the law
which He has given and confirmed in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; And let
none cheat themselves into thinking that if they manage to keep
the sin secret, and to be free from the burden and shame of the
birth of a child, there is any the less real harm in it.&nbsp; It
is the foul blot of the unclean deed upon the soul, the stain
before God, that is the evil to be dreaded most.&nbsp; That stain
is the same whether it is kept hidden from the world or not, just
as the lie is a sin on the soul, all the same, though it should
never be found out.</p>
<p>Oh my dear child! when I think of the depths to which a woman
may sink, a depth of infamy I do not dare to put before you in
all its terrible plainness, I tremble to think of any young girl
listening to the man or woman who would lead her to look upon
this sin lightly.&nbsp; Turn your mind from the very thought of
it.&nbsp; Shut your ears against it.&nbsp; Let it not once be
named.&nbsp; Pray to God in your daily prayer, to hold you back
from that temptation, to deliver you from that evil, to keep you
by His Holy Spirit from impure desires and from occasion of
falling; and ask Him for the purity of heart which will make you
pure in living.</p>
<p>I cannot write more.&nbsp; My heart is too full of
trouble.&nbsp; May God have you in his safe keeping.&nbsp; Your
affectionate aunt,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><b>MARGARET ROTHWAITE</b>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;That is my aunt Margaret&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo;
said worthy Mrs. Ellerbeck, as she folded up a large
old-fashioned letter sheet, and wrapped it in a handkerchief, and
laid it back in the drawer.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is my good
aunt&rsquo;s letter, and I have blessed her for it all these
forty years back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish,&rdquo; answered I, &ldquo;that many a one
had just such another friend, to stand between her and
ruin.&nbsp; It is always a grief to me that young girls who must
needs work for their living are so often thrown into dangerous
situations, as in factories, or town apprenticeships, or in
country farm service; or, indeed, anywhere, if no one will hold
out a hand to keep them back from harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is scarce any young girl, in our line of
life,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ellerbeck, &ldquo;either at home or in
service, but what a plain word would come well to; for even at
the best of homes there are always ways enough to go wrong; and
what between some of their elders being too careless, and some
too shame-faced, young folks don&rsquo;t hear these truths as
much as they need to do.&nbsp; Many a one first gets the
knowledge, sadly enough, at her own cost, when it is too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed a cruel thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not
to warn and guard the young against a peril like this that besets
them everywhere.&nbsp; But if any one might have been safely left
to herself, I should have thought it would have been you Mrs.
Ellerbeck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered my worthy friend, &ldquo;I needed
the warning as ill as any one just then; for I had got to hear
some very free opinions from an unprincipled young fellow, who
had some law work at our house about a land lease, and who was
uncommon clever at putting a bad notion into fair words.&nbsp;
There are those who can shift a meaning to any side, and turn
even a scripture text backwards way; and they will talk <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>you down, and
tell you this is not this, and that follows the other, till they
well nigh drive a simple body to think none before them had ever
seen their way to take a pair of tongs by the right end: and how
was it likely a young lass would see through that sort of craft,
and least of all if she was blindfolded by being a good bit
noticed and flattered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how was it,&rdquo; asked I, &ldquo;that your
excellent father did not at once put a stop to such
talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ellerbeck, &ldquo;it
was never carried on in his hearing, but only at bye moments,
waiting for him, and the like.&nbsp; And it was this very hiding
and scheming that helped me to give more heed to my aunt&rsquo;s
warning; for, thought I, if all this is really so true and right,
why not speak it out openly? and why should I hang back myself
from letting my father hear it?&nbsp; Ah! if people would but
believe there is certain mischief in what is in the dark and
underhand!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always Faulty that needs to
skulk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be more certain,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
now may I ask, was this letter of your aunt&rsquo;s, the good
angel, as we may say, that warded off the evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was like having a candle brought into a dark
room,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Ellerbeck.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, after
all, holding up the light to people is only half the battle; for
many a one will rather shut their eyes than look an unwelcome
truth in the face, and none are so blind as those that
won&rsquo;t see.&nbsp; I say it with sorrow, Not the best any one
can say or do, can turn others from wrong to right, unless they
have some care themselves for good above bad, and something of a
mind to serve their Maker: and I thank God&rsquo;s grace I had
that much; and my aunt&rsquo;s letter worked upon it.&nbsp; It
was, may-be, a bit of a struggle at first to do it; but I called
my father in, and then the young fellow drew <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>off quickly
enough.&nbsp; If a man means well by a woman he can bear a
father&rsquo;s eye, and never flinch; but above-board is no card
for the deceiver.&nbsp; Aye, aye! I have reason to bless my good
aunt&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; And,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Ellerbeck,
as a tear rose to her eye, &ldquo;when I look now with a sort of
grateful pride upon my own good man, and think in all the years
we waited before we married, how true we were to our Bible laws,
and blameless between ourselves before God and man, and what
trust and honour we have had for one another in every change in
life to our grey old age, and how we can each of us warn son and
daughter against loose doings with a good face, my heart stirs
with a longing that I could draw over others to hold fast to
honour and modest ways, and to keep off from what will bring them
trouble and repentance, and stand in their light all their life
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, Mrs. Ellerbeck,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if
that is your mind, will you let me put this letter of your
aunt&rsquo;s into print, and what you have said along with it
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye that I will,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;and may
God&rsquo;s blessing go with it!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And now, Good Friends, men or women, all you who have at heart
the good of others, and the welfare of your country, all who can
estimate the worth of honour in man and purity in woman, join us
in the attempt to arrest this growing evil of licentiousness
which, above every other form of vice, poisons the springs of our
domestic and social well-being, by degrading woman&rsquo;s
character, and making her who should be man&rsquo;s heavenward
help and purest earthly stay, his fellow in grossness and even
his decoy to vice.&nbsp; It is impossible to exaggerate an evil
which so debases our most sacred relationships, disordering
family ties, lowering the dignity of marriage, casting shame upon
the holy name of mother, and, so to say, plucking the rose from
the forehead of pure love and stamping it with the brand of
lust.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Parents&mdash;but mothers especially&mdash;we call upon
you to help in the good work.&nbsp; Surely you of all others have
most interest in it, as it must in nature be your dearest wish to
see your sons true, and your daughters virtuous.&nbsp; Yet this
cannot be unless you will yourselves sow the early seeds.&nbsp;
The school and the church do not form the character.&nbsp; The
pastor and teacher will urge self-restraint in vain if the home
manners and example are slack in recommending it.&nbsp; Consider
the lasting effect of early impressions throughout life, and how
surely you may make them work for good in this respect, if you
will check your boys betimes in coarse speech and action, and
speak to them more plainly of the sin of unchastity, and of the
baseness and crime of seduction, and train them, as they grow
older, to understand the sanctity of true love, and to value and
respect modesty in woman.</p>
<p>And especially we would urge you to watch over your girls from
their childish years upwards, and in all possible ways to foster
their natural modesty.&nbsp; Accustom them to hear more commonly
at the home fireside, from parents&rsquo; lips, how excellent a
thing is true womanly worth in daughter, sister, and wife, and
how grievous the loss of it; how contrary to true feminine
dignity are forward manners, flashy dress, and every other bait
for men&rsquo;s free notice.&nbsp; And we would earnestly press
upon you to use your rightful authority more firmly in forbidding
those sure leadings to mischief, late hours, bad company, and
wild merry makings, such as the public-house dance, the theatre,
or loose revels of whatsoever kind, in town or country.&nbsp;
What but evil can come of that fatal habit of indulgence which,
rather than cross a thoughtless wish, will let youth run headlong
into temptations which it has not even the sense to fear, and has
hardly the chance of overcoming.</p>
<p>And you, Young Women, who have above all others the most
direct power in your own hands, give us the best of all
help&mdash;that of your own pure example.&nbsp; The men are what
the women make them.&nbsp; If you will be modest, and true to
yourselves, they will shape their ways accordingly; if you, by
your true worth, will claim respect and honour from them, they
will undoubtedly yield the just tribute to you.&nbsp; If you will
resolve to follow the gospel law, and serve your God in the
purity He enjoins, admitting no love dealings but what have the
warrant of heaven, you will help them to do likewise.&nbsp;
Whereas, if by your own forwardness you invite them to loose
advances, you become in fact their tempters, and the workers of
your own degradation.</p>
<p>Waken up to your responsibilities&mdash;you, the daughters,
wives, and mothers of our cottage homes.&nbsp; You have more of
your country&rsquo;s honour and welfare depending upon you than
you are aware of; for home influences are wholly in women&rsquo;s
hands, and each home puts forth its growth for good or evil, each
is a small seed-plot of virtue or vice, which is, we may say
truly, given in charge to the woman, &ldquo;to dress it and to
keep it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not only the children of a family
that are moulded by the woman&rsquo;s hands; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>she gives the
tone and character to all the household.&nbsp; Where the mother
is looked up to with reverence and love, and the elder sister
leads onwards in good ways, there will be an influence for good
over all; nor will it be confined to the single home; it will
have its effect on a neighbourhood.&nbsp; And alas! for the
opposite case!&nbsp; Who can say how far the evil influences of
one disorderly family may reach, or of one woman of reprobate
habits, who &ldquo;forgetteth the covenant of her God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are all Christians in name; but are we not sometimes more
zealous for the form of our faith than for its fruits?&nbsp; Many
who contend warmly over some of the more doubtful points of
doctrine, are less careful than they should be to lay to heart
the plainer truths and the weightier matters of the law.&nbsp;
There are those who call themselves Bible christians, and talk
readily of Gospel truth.&nbsp; What says the Gospel?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Flee fornication.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be not deceived;
neither fornicators, nor adulterers shall inherit the kingdom of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; What are our Saviour&rsquo;s words?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Adulteries, fornications, &amp;c., these are the things
which defile a man.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are Gospel truths.&nbsp;

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
